### Proposal for BIOS 611 Project 1

______

#### 1. A description of the data set.

I am using two datasets for my analysis. The first is a dataset of data associated with one coral "core" collected from the Florida Keys in 2014. The analysis of coral cores is similar to that of analyzing the rings on a tree - they provide information about a coral's annual growth. This dataset includes linear extension data, calcification, and skeletal density for each year since 1890. By comparing historical coral growth to environmental data, we can better understand the environmental conditions that lead to variations in coral growth. Along this same vein, the second dataset that I am using is of all storms that came within 500km of this coral core since 1988 (although there is some less detailed data available for earlier years if I decide I want to explore it). This dataset also includes other values such as wind speed, storm radius, etc.

I obtained this data set from my research advisor, so I'm excited to explore it and potentially contribute to our understanding of the effect of storms on coral growth.

#### 2. Some very preliminary figures.

### 3. A description of a handful of questions you hope to be able to answer about the dataset.

- Do storms impact coral growth?
  - What is the relationship between storm distance and coral growth?
  - What is the relationship between storm intensity and coral growth?
  - What is the relationship between storm frequency and coral growth?

### 4. A proposal to do some modeling or more advanced visualizations on the data set.

I would be interested in incorporating seawater temperature data and seeing whether my findings about the relationship between storms and coral growth are still supported. I would also be interested in incorporating existing models of future storm frequency/intensity in the Florida Keys and predicting the potential impact on coral growth.

My advisor also has 1) more storm data, albeit less detailed, for previous years and 2) coral growth data for many more samples. It would be ideal if I could expand my analysis to this additional data.

### 5. Some criteria for completion.

My criteria for completion for the purposes of this project would be to create visualizations depicting the relationship between storm distance, intensity, and frequency and coral growth.

- This will require tidying the storm data, which includes multiple data entries for each storm, and a varying number of entries for each storm. I need to figure out how best to handle this, as each of these entries is different depending on at which time point it represents.
